Class Invariants
-----------------------
1. Every field has to be an integer with a positive value.

2. There always has to be a person that is infected.

3. The probability for a person to get infected is always lower if he/she wears a mask.

4. The probabilities that are given by the user have to always be between 0 and 100.

5. The number of the people in the simulation must always be the sum of healthy, infected and immune people.

6. The number of the people in the simulation must not exceed the product of height and width of the grid.

7. For the purpose of this simulation, height and width have to be always below 50, so that the simulation 
   is ran with  a good flow and doesen't take took long to be drawn each time people move.

8. Two people cannot be placed in the same place at the same time.

9. Immune people cannot get infected or transmit the virus.

10. If the area has reached it's maximum capacity(crowd >= height * width) of people, the person that was 
    supposed to move to this area after he entered the appropriate border, will not eventually move because 
    then the area will become overcrowded.

11. The same boorder (coordinates) cannot lead to two or more different areas.

12. User can only enter the coordinates in this form: x,y

13. Borders have a maximum amount that cannot surpass.

14. An area cannot border with itself.

15. All the borders can only be on the edges.

16. Areas names are only charactes from 'A' to 'Z'.

17. There is a limited amount of areas that can be used in the simulation(<=26), as each area's name is a character.
    So there cannot be more than 26 areas. 

18. An area cannot border with more than the existing areas.

19. Each succesive area border squares should be vertical or horizontal.
